    <town id="moscow">
    You arrive in Moscow. The town is eerily silent. The oppressive regime of the Grand Prince has the people firmly underfoot. The occasional squad of Oprichniki stalk the streets. They are the Grand Prince's enforcers. They expect you to be on your best behavior. You disembark and begin to explore the town.

  Planet Earth is highly misunderstood for humans.Scientifically speaking we only know answers to a point even though the question "why" could go on forever.We always try to find answers only finding out that communication is the hardest thing to accomplish in life.With many mixtures in cultures there are so many ways with communication such as Tone of voice,facial expressions,Words having more then one meaning.All this being tied up all together we have found that it has caused a history of wars.All because of misunderstandings and others beliefs.Some of us want to come together and make things better then they where in the past while some of us want to continue passing on hate-red. The ones that have hate-red feel they know the correct answer while the ones who don't have hate-red can't grasp the answer.
